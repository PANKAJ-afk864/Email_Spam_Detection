# Email Spam Detection

This project is a machine learning-based email spam detection system developed using a Jupyter Notebook. It analyzes and classifies emails as "spam" or "not spam" using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Text vectorization with TF-IDF
- Classification using models like Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
